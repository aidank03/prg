  <p>
    The Earlham Plasma Research Group (PRG) is a research group at Earlham College in Richmond, IN. Using Earlham's Advanced Physics Laboratory, students may conduct experiments under high vacuum using a variety of resources.
    While experiments may be conducted in a wide range of fields, the PRG focuses on low energy plasmasa and plasma applications to controlled fusion research.

  <p>
    The purpose of the PRG website is to direct interested students to Earlham's PRG lab and to provide a collection of resources for students to learn Fusion Sciences on their own.
